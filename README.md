# CSC 7901 Capstone Tiny ML
The repo contains the locally run experiments and data processing notebooks used throughout the capstone.

Additionally, a zip folder is included containing a functioning example of capturing an image using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 and camera 0v7670.
File contents:
camera_capture_w_processing_Ov7670: Arduino sketch
process_camera_data: code that runs on a third-party tool that decodes serialized captured data by the camera and displays it (refer to this link to download third-party app called Processing: https://processing.org/download). The third-party app was discovered from this tutorial on running camera capture (https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/06/24/machine-vision-with-low-cost-camera-modules/).
